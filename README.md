### How to initialize the project
- After cloning the project to your local machine. Cd into the project's root directory and Run `npm i` or `npm install` to install the necessary packages.

- To start the project, run `npm run start` in your terminal and open `localhost:8080` in your browser.

- Any changes made in your HTML or Javascript file will trigger a hot reload, so you don't need to rerun `npm run start` to see any of your changes :)
